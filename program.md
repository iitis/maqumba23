## Other activities
A conference dinner* and a half-day sightseeing trip will be organized and will be included in the conference fee. We will post more information soon.

*In light of the recent earthquake that hit the region of Marrakech, the organization committee of Quantum Morocco decided to cancel the conference dinner and re-direct its funds to <a href="https://www.bkam.ma/en/News/2023/Make-your-donations-to-the-special-fund" target="_blank" > the special fund </a>
 for the earthquake victims. The special fund is directed by Bank Al Maghrib, which is the central bank of Morocco.
