## Scoop and Aim
The Faculty of Sciences at Mohammed V University in Rabat hosted the first edition of the Quantum Morocco conference from the 18th to the 22nd of September 2023. 
The conference focused on the recent developments in the field of quantum science, with a particular focus on quantum computing and its practical implementations. 
The event's goal is to push the position of Morocco in the global race toward quantum supremacy by raising awareness among the Moroccan science community about the fast-growing field of quantum science through the talks and lectures given by internationally leading experts in the field of quantum science. 
Moreover, the conference aimed at building collaborations between  Moroccan and international scientists from academia and industry. The conference was free of charge for Moroccan students.
